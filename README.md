# CrowdSim
CrowdSim is the name of this repository holding all the contents in regard to thesis work for a Master of Science in Engineering and Policy Analysis at the Delft University of Technology. It includes:

- An agent-based pedestrian crowd model of the Grote Markt shopping area in Breda, The Netherlands, made with Vadere.
  - The model files includes in the `model` directory can directly be loaded into the Vadere GUI
  - All utilized Vadere model scenario files are present, including configurations used for validation purposes
  - Individual model results are not included due to significant file sizes. These can however be generated by running the model yourself. Note that the seed is set for certain model configurations, such as ones used for validation purposes, to enable reproducibility.
- All used data files and other resources in the `data` directory:
  - GIS based images and data files
  - Input datasets
  - All generated outcomes using the EMA Workbench
  - Script used for data conversion
- An extensive collection of high resolution images and generated graphs
- Utilities based on tools provided by the Vadere group
  - The script used for converting OSM data to Vadere objects. 
- The EMA Workbench connector to Vadere models
  - Full source code
  - Documentation and usage instructions
